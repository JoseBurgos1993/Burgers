# Burgers
For this assignment, I was to create an app where the user can input burger names and then devour the burgers. Each burger created is added to an ever growing list. Next to each burger is a button that lets the user eat it. Once eaten, that burger is put into a new list below. The front-end is created by using handlebars as a template. The app is deployed on heroku and uses JAWS_DB for MySQL support.

The github repository is [here](https://github.com/JoseBurgos1993/Burgers). The deployed page can be located [here](https://blooming-harbor-53033.herokuapp.com/).
